										<p>Welcome to Zaka International, a Kenyan-based limited liability company (together with its affiliates, officers, directors, agents, employees, representatives, partners and their respective affiliates, collectively, "zaka").

											Zaka may make changes to this agreement at any time. When we do, you’ll know we’ve updated it by looking at the date at the top of the page.</p>
											<p>This Agreement is divided into the following sections:</p>

											<p>
												<ul class="angles">
													<h4><strong>1. Participation in the Zaka Platform</strong></h4>
													<p>Zaka manages the Website, which connects you and other participants in the marketplace/platform (ie "Lender" and, collectively, "Lenders") with borrowers and social enterprises in various countries in need of affordable capital (each, a "Borrower" and, collectively, "Borrowers"). In most instances, these SME Borrowers are considered "high risk" by traditional lenders for a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the Borrowers' lack of credit history, the use  of the loan proceeds for entrepreneurial endeavors including investment in a "start up" business, and the geographic location including the risk of financial instability and foreign exchange rate fluctuations</p>
															 <p>This section describes what Zaka does and does not do. Investment/lending on Zaka website is risky and you might not get repaid what you lend. You may participate in the Program as an investor by creating an online account on the Zaka website registered to your email address. All transactions between Investors (Lenders) and Entrepreneurs (Borrowers) must be conducted through a Zaka account – which means technically speaking, Zaka may be considered the “lender” on your behalf when you make Loans on the Website. The amount of funds you have available in your Zaka account that you have deposited and is freely available to be lent out is referred to as your "Zaka Credit." If you make a loan through the Zaka Website, you are in essence instructing Zaka to utilize your Zaka Credit to fund the specific Loan you have designated on the Website. All Zaka Credit in your Zaka account must be lent and repaid to your account before you can withdraw it.</p>
															 <p>You are required to register and create an account to transact on the Zaka platform. Money in your account (wallet) is called “Zaka credit” and it can be used to make loans on Zaka.co.ke. You can’t withdraw money from your account until it’s been lent out to a borrower and repaid to your account.
															 By participating in the Zaka Program or otherwise accessing or using the Zaka Website, you hereby acknowledge and agree that <li>(a) Zaka makes no representation, warranty, covenant or guarantee that any funds you lend to a Borrower via the Website will be repaid in whole or in part,</li> <li>(b) loans and other similar transactions made via the Website are unsecured and bear a high risk of non-repayment and</li> <li>(c) given your financial situation and objectives, you will lend only those amounts on the Website that you can afford to risk.</li> Loans made via the Website are not cancellable or refundable by the User.
															 Zaka will hold amounts due and payable to Investors (Lenders) and Entrepreneurs (Borrowers separate from Zaka’s funds, in a deposit account established to hold funds for the benefit of Participants. Zaka will not use such amounts for Zaka’s general operating expenses; however, Zaka reserves the right to retain (a) interest on funds while such funds are held in a Participants Funds Account and (b) any foreign exchange gains collected in connection with Loan repayments, and to use such interest and gains in support of Zaka’s general operating expenses.
														 </p>
			<h4><strong>1.1 Description of Products & Services</strong></h4>
													<p>Zaka is an online platform (marketplace) where entrepreneurs (borrowers) and investors (Lenders) interact directly on deals that will favour business growth and mutually benefit both parties – ie entrepreneurs and investors. The investors and entrepreneurs have the power to determine favourable terms and overcome the barriers to capital access.</p>
			<h4><strong>1.2 Loan disbursment</strong></h4>

													<p>Zaka Loans are made directly to Entrepreneurs (Borrowers) by a network of investors (Lenders) registered in Zaka platform. Entrepreneur loan requests are submitted by Borrowers and approved by Zaka before they are posted to the Website. Funds loaned by you, the Lender, will be transferred directly to the account of the Borrower you have chosen to support. Zaka serves as a middle-man in the process and aggregates funds from multiple Lenders via the Website and delivers 100% of these funds (excluding the interest earned, if any, on such funds while they are held in a Participants Funds Account, which interest is contributed toward funding Zaka’s operations) to the Borrower. Zaka expressly disclaims any responsibility to screen Borrowers or monitor Borrowers’ operations. Zaka and Directors shall have no liability whatsoever with respect to such screening or selection of Borrowers, and you shall hold Zaka and the Directors harmless from any and all liabilities with respect to, or resulting from such screening and selection of Borrowers.</p>
			<h4><strong>1.3 Loan collection and repayment</strong></h4>

													<p>Zaka Loans are repaid directly by Borrowers to Lenders. Repayments may be made in periodic installments, depending on the terms of the applicable Loan or as a bullet repayment of principle and interest. If, for any reason, Zaka, for any reason, is unable to collect Loan repayments directly from an entrepreneur (Borrower), repayment of your Loan amounts could be at risk of partial or total delay or non-repayment and a loss of some or all of your principal could occur. You hereby acknowledge and agree that Zaka bears no direct contractual obligation or liability to pay you any principal plus interest and that Zaka is only obligated to repay only such Loan principal plus interest to the extent actually received by Zaka from an entrepreneur (Borrower). None of Zaka or its directors will have any obligation to pay penalties or other fees or amounts (other than as expressly set forth above) to you or any other Lender in connection with any Loan you make on Zaka Platform.</p>
													<h4><strong>1.4       Principal plus Interest Loss Cases.</strong></h4>
			<p>Zaka will do it’s absolute best to collect principal plus interest on loans made on the Zaka Platform. A loan will be deemed in default if Zaka determines that collection of funds for such Loan is doubtful. You understand and hereby consent (without any prior notice thereof) to any restructuring of the repayment plan for your Loan(s) and/or, in Zaka’s sole discretion, any extension of the length of the term of your Loan(s) in order to increase the chances that your Loan(s) will be repaid in whole or in part.
			In addition to loan defaults, you may lose money because of changing currency exchange rates. Zaka loans are made in Kenya Shillings, but Investors may make loans in their country currency eh Euros, US dollars. This exposes the investor to exchange loss risk. If for any reason less than 100% of your Loan is repaid, you agree that neither Zaka nor its directors shall have any liability therefore, and you hereby release and forever hold harmless Zaka, for any loss you may incur. You should consult with your accountant and/or tax advisors to determine the appropriate tax treatment of such a loss.</p>
			<h4><strong>1.5       Tax Deductibility.</strong></h4>
			<p>You acknowledge that making a Loan on the Zaka Website does not constitute a charitable donation, and therefore you are not eligible to receive a tax deduction for any funds lent to a Borrower through the Website. You also understand that you are solely responsible for determining the proper tax treatment for any Loan you make through the Zaka Website. Zaka has not and will not provide any tax or legal advice to you in connection with any Loan you might make. This Agreement does not attempt to define the tax implications of participating in the Program. If you participate in the Program, you should consult with your own accountants, tax advisors and legal advisors.</p>
			<h4><strong>1.6       Loan Records.</strong></h4>
			<p>Records of each Loan you make are kept by Zaka and, if you have a registered account with Zaka and upon your written request, will be made available to you at any time throughout the term of the Loan.</p>
			<h4><strong>1.7       Zaka Account Inactivity/Dormancy;</strong></h4>
			<p>In the event a Zaka user (investor or entrepreneur) fails to operate their account for a period greater than 24 months, the said user will be deemed dormant. You required to instruct Zaka how you would like the funds in your Zaka Credit to be treated/applied:
			Automatically donate remaining funds in your account to Zaka’s general operating expenses to further Zaka’s philanthropic mission
			Return the remaining funds in your account to you via Zaka’s standard account withdrawal process.</p>
			<p>In such cases of User inactivity, Zaka may choose to automatically terminate the inactive User account without further reference to yourself.
			During registration on the Zaka Website you will be prompted to instruct Zaka on treatment of the remaining balance in case of dormancy</p>
			<h4><strong>2. Additional Zaka Website Features</strong></h4>
			<h4><strong>2.1      Auto-lending.</strong></h4>
			<p>Zaka platform allows investors to automatically re-lend their funds on full repayment of previous loan. In this case Zaka gives lenders the option to have their Kiva credit automatically lent and re-lent according to criteria they set in advance. Zaka isn’t liable for any money you lose on loans made using this feature, and auto loans cannot be canceled.
			You agree and understand that all Resources are provided on an “AS IS” and “WITH ALL FAULTS” basis, without warranties or representations of any kind, either express or implied. Your use of the Resources is at your sole risk, and Zaka expressly disclaims all liability arising from or relating to the Resources. While Zaka strives to provide useful and accurate information, Zaka does not warrant that the information offered in the Resources is free of errors or opinion biases. You further understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to content that may be deemed offensive or objectionable, and you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you may have against Zaka with respect to the Resources.</p>
			<h4><strong>3. Acceptable Use</strong></h4>
			<h4><strong>3.1       Appropriate Conduct.</strong></h4> <p>You may access and use the Website for your personal, non-commercial use in connection with the Program (provided that Borrowers may promote their businesses on their Loan profile pages). The Website may not be accessed or used by you in connection with any other endeavors – commercial or otherwise – except as previously approved in writing by an authorized representative of Zaka. Your access and use of the Website and participation in the Program shall be in strict compliance with this Agreement, including, without limitation, all other procedures and guidelines set forth on the Website and as part of the Program, as well as applicable law. Only authorized Entrepreneurs (Borrowers) may seek Loans on the Website or otherwise through the Program (provided that you may apply to become an authorized Borrower through Zaka’s formal application process). Zaka has the right to investigate and take appropriate legal action (including, without limitation, civil, criminal and injunctive redress) against any illegal and/or unauthorized uses of the Website or exploitations of the Program, including collecting or harvesting (whether or not by automated scripts) the name, email address or any other personal or confidential information of any User, Borrower or any other person by electronic or other means for any reason, including, without limitation, the purpose of sending unsolicited email and unauthorized framing of or linking to the Website.</p>
			<p>You may not use the Website in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden or impair the Website or software, systems or equipment of ZAka or any User, or other person. You may not use the Website in any manner that, in Zaka’s sole discretion, creates a poor user experience for any other User, such as by posting content specifically designed to attract a negative reaction from an individual or group, or by “keyword stuffing” lending team pages (loading a page description with keywords in an attempt to manipulate the page’s ranking in search results). Although Zaka assumes no obligation to monitor the conduct of any User on or off the Website or through the Program, it is a violation of this
			Agreement to use the Website or Program, or any information obtained from the Website or Program, in order to:<li> (i) harass, abuse, or harm another person (including, but not limited to, using profanity in lender messages or creating or joining lending teams in bad faith), </li><li>(ii) prevent or exclude others, who are using the Website in compliance with this Agreement, from accessing, viewing or funding a particular Borrower profile,</li><li> (iii) promote or enable illegal activities,</li><li> (iv) defraud or deceive any person, </li><li>(v) promote or solicit involvement in support of any political platform, legislation or campaign activity for or against political candidates, </li><li>(vi) publicly share information about a Borrower’s delinquency or default, </li><li>(vii) access and use the Website by scripts, bots or other automated technology, </li><li>(viii) contact, advertise to, solicit, "spam," or sell to any Investor, Director, Entrepreneur or other person without their prior explicit consent (provided that Entrepreneur may promote their businesses to Investors in a respectful way), or </li><li>(ix) post, upload, submit, transmit or otherwise share any content, including, but not limited to, written materials or images, that in Zaka’s opinion is obscene, harassing, contains profanity, or may be hateful or offensive on racial, ethnic, sexual or any other grounds; is harmful, vulgar or distasteful; contains graphic or gratuitous violence; is defamatory, libelous, or invades another person's privacy or proprietary rights; or contains viruses, time bombs, trojan horses, cancelbots, worms or other harmful or disruptive codes, components or devices.
			Zaka reserves the right at all times (but will not have an obligation) to restrict, suspend or terminate the participation of any User or any lending team from the Website and the Program at any time, with or without prior notice. In order to protect Users and other persons from advertising, solicitation or harassment, Zaka reserves the right to remove or refuse to post or distribute any content from the Website that violates acceptable use in Zaka’s sole discretion and restrict the number of emails or messages that a User may send to others through the Website in any 24-hour or other period to a number that Zaka deems appropriate, in Zaka’s sole and absolute discretion.</li></li>
			<h4><strong>3.2       Safety and Security.</strong></h4>
